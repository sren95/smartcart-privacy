# SmartCart Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** January 2026

SmartCart ("the App") is a golf course management application. This policy explains how we handle your data.

---

## Data We Collect

### Location Data

The App accesses your device's location to:
- Display your position on golf course maps
- Calculate distances to course features (greens, hazards, etc.)

**Location data is processed locally on your device and is not stored or transmitted externally.**

### Course Data You Create

When you create a golf course in the App, the following data is stored locally on your device:
- Course name and details
- Hole information (zones, paths, par, handicap, distances)
- Map coordinates for course features

This data remains on your device unless you choose to upload it.

### Uploaded Course Data

If you choose to upload a course to share with other users, the following data is transmitted to and stored using Apple's iCloud (CloudKit) infrastructure:
- Course name and details
- All hole and zone information
- Map coordinates for course features

**Uploading is entirely optional.** You can use all course creation and play features without uploading any data.

## How We Use Your Data

| Data | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Location | Display your position on course maps, calculate distances |
| Local course data | Enable course creation and play features on your device |
| Uploaded course data | Share courses with other SmartCart users; improve and expand the App's course database |

## Uploaded Course Data: License Grant

**By uploading a course, you grant SmartCart a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, transferable license to use, modify, distribute, and display that course data for any purpose, including but not limited to:**
- Sharing with other users of the App
- Improving the App and its features
- Creating derivative works
- Commercial purposes, including licensing to third parties

Uploaded course data becomes part of the SmartCart course database. You should not upload courses if you do not agree to these terms.

**You retain any copyright you hold in original content you create**, but the license you grant is irrevocable and does not require attribution.

---

## Data Sharing

Uploaded courses are shared publicly with other SmartCart users. Course data may also be used commercially or shared with third parties.

Local data that you do not upload is not shared with anyone.

---

## Data Storage and Security

- **Local data** is stored on your device using standard iOS data protection
- **Uploaded data** is stored using Apple's iCloud (CloudKit) infrastructure and transmitted using encryption (HTTPS)

We rely on Apple's security measures for data stored in CloudKit. For more information, see [Apple's Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/privacy/).

## Your Choices

You can:
- **Use the App entirely offline** — No data leaves your device
- **Delete local courses** — Remove any course from your device at any time
- **Choose not to upload** — Keep your courses private on your device

---

## Children's Privacy

SmartCart does not collect personal information from users. Course mapping data (hole layouts, zone coordinates, par values) does not identify individuals. The App does not require accounts, names, emails, or other personal identifiers to function.

Location data is used only for on-device display and distance calculations, and is not stored or transmitted.

We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.
